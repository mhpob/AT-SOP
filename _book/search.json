You will be greeted by a blank home page:\n\nClick the “refresh” button in the top-left of the screen to scan for receivers.

This provides information on battery usage (both CPU and release battery if connected to an acoustic-release receiver), memory usage, connection type (Bluetooth or cabled), internal transmitter status, study metadata, and logged detections and pings.\n\nTo offload data, click the “download” button near the top-left of the screen.\n\nA pop-up will appear asking where you would like the file to be saved and whether you want to offload all data or just new data. Adjust settings and click “Start”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nI suggest always selecting “Offload All Data” to hedge against data loss by having redundant records.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFiles are saved to C:\\Users\\USERNAME\\Documents\\Innovasea\\Fathom\\YYYY-mm-DD, where “USERNAME” is your computer’s user name and “YYYY-mm-DD” is today’s date. The “YYYY-MM-DD” portion will be automatically created in the listed directory.\n\n\n\nFathom Connect will ask you to confirm that your computer’s time is correct. If your computer has been connected to the internet for a few minutes, click “OK”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIf your computer has not been connected to the internet for some time, it has likely experienced clock drift (yes, like a receiver!!). Before proceeding, you should confirm your time with a clock that has been connected to the internet (your phone, another computer, etc.).\n\n\n\nYou will be shown a progress window, culminating in (hopefully) a notification of success!\nNote that the file name is of the form MODEL-KHZ SERIAL YYYY-mm-DD HHMMSS.vdat, spaces included.\n\nNavigate to the file location to confirm that the file has been downloaded and is where you think it is. By default, the file downloaded above went to C:\\Users\\MYUSERNAME\\Documents\\Innovasea\\Fathom\\2024-12-17 as it was created on December 17, 2024.",

    "text": "1.5 Internal transmitter\n\n1.5.1 Long-term detection range\nIf multiple receivers are planned to be deployed within “earshot” of each other (generally within 200-800 meters, environment-dependent) and your receiver has the capability (anything that isn’t a VR2W), it is worthwhile to activate the internal transmitter in order to characterize detection range during the receiver’s future deployment.\nSelect the Sync Tag option. This will emit the receiver’s programmed transmitter ID every ten minutes, on average.\n\nSelect a power level that is comparable to the targeted transmitters, listed below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAt the time of this writing, the most commonly-deployed transmitters are V16s; the power level should be set to “High” or “Very High”, with a preference to “Very High” as most studies utilize high power to increase detectability.\n\n\n\nVery High = 160 dB\nHigh = 154 dB\nMedium = 148 dB\nLow = 142 dB\n\nTransmitter power:\n\nV16 = 152-162 dB re 1 \\(\\mu\\)Pa @ 1m\nV13 = 147-152 dB re 1 \\(\\mu\\)Pa @ 1m\nV9 = 146-151 dB re 1 \\(\\mu\\)Pa @ 1m\nV8 = 144-147 dB re 1 \\(\\mu\\)Pa @ 1m\nV7 and V6 = 137-141 dB re 1 \\(\\mu\\)Pa @ 1m\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nInternal transmitter power is not provided at a reference distance and pressure – this is purposeful, as these are not calibrated values and could be off depending on anything from manufacturing variation to the deployed environment. Because of this, we’re just trying to get in the correct range rather than trying to exactly match any values.",

    "text": "Note\n\n\n\n\n\nAdapted from protocols developed by Bonnie Ahr, Kennedy Space Center.\n\n\n\n\nPlace VR100 on flat surface when possible\nOnly connect the transponding hydrophone when receiver is powered OFF.\nSelect TRANSPOND from VR100 main menu\nIf “CANNOT COMMUNICATE WITH TRANSPONDER1 appears, disconnect and reconnect the hydrophone then select TRANSPOND again\nWait for the vessel to stop moving\nPlace hydrophone in water and select TRANSPOND from VR100 main menu\nSelect the ADD DEVICE option manually or by pressing “2”\nADD the serial number of the unit you are hoping to release and press OK\nSelect ACOUSTIC RELEASE manually or by pressing “3”\nSelect ACTIVATE manually or by pressing “3” again\nListen for a response from the receiver through the VR100 speaker; “Sx”, where “x” is a number, may also flash on the screen. If the response is successfully received and decoded, you will see the message saying “Opening” in the deck box screen and the distance of the hydrophone from the receiver. If you heard a response from the speaker in the form of rhythmic “clicks” but did not see an “Opening” message, the unit has still been released\nAfter a few seconds, Select STATUS to update the release status and depth. If the release is successful, the screen will show the message “Open” and you should notice the depth changed. If the receiver is stuck at the same depth after a few STATUS attempts, you can consider the unit “stuck”\n\n\n2.1.1 Troubleshooting\n\n2.1.1.1 Poor Communication\n\nSet TRANSMIT POWER to a lower setting to reduce echo noise. The default is 7 (high). Moving 30-50m from the location of the receiver may also help.\nYou can also switch the detection parameter between Near, Normal, and Far. Most units will communicate better in the Normal setting, but if there is trouble establishing a connection, it is worth trying the other settings.\nMove the hydrophone away from the vessel’s depth transponder or turn the depth transponder off if you hear constant rapid clicking; depth transponders emit noise at 69 kHz that may interfere with communication.\nIf current, tides, or winds are strong-enough to make the vessel drift as indicated by the hydrophone cable running at an angle from the vessel, move the vessel so that the angle of the hydrophone’s cable points roughly in the direction of the receiver.\nSelect STATUS/GET RANGE to establish a communications link. This is particularly good to check on some parameters such as depth, tilt and horizontal range (“hRange”) information. This range is often accurate to the distance where the equipment will surface in relation to the vessel. Tilt will be able to indicate if the mooring is still straight up, which means recovery will be successful if the equipment release mechanism does not fail.\nSelect AUTOSCAN (TRANSPOND &gt; Option 1) to wake up all receivers within listening distance. Useful in case of lost or mis-recorded receiver serial numbers.\n\nThe length of time the VR100 listens for a response during AUTOSCAN increases each time this option is selected. It may be necessary to reset the transponding session after multiple failed connections to reduce the listening time and increase the frequency of connection attempts. Note that this also resets any custom configurations including the transmission power level. To reset the session, Select TRANSPONDING from the main menu (3rd option), then RESET SESSION (3rd option).\n\n\n\n\n2.1.1.2 Receiver not surfacing\nPossible causes:\n\nObstructions\n\nfishing line or gear, tree branches, discarded dishwashers\n\nBiofouling causing loss in buoyancy of buoy\nSedimentation and burial\nLow battery\n\nIn some instances of very low receiver battery, replying to a STATUS or GET RANGE command will deplete the battery enough to prevent a complete release.",
