### Deployment 

  - Place VR100 on flat surface when possible
  - Only connect the transponding hydrophone when receiver is powered OFF.
  - Select **TRANSPOND** from VR100 main menu
  - If "**CANNOT COMMUNICATE WITH TRANSPONDER**[^1] appears, disconnect and reconnect the hydrophone then select **TRANSPOND** again
  - Wait for the vessel to stop moving
  - Place hydrophone in water and select **TRANSPOND** from VR100 main menu
  - Select the **ADD DEVICE** option manually or by pressing "**2**"
  - ADD the serial number of the unit you are hoping to release and press **OK**
  - Select **ACOUSTIC RELEASE** manually or by pressing "**3**"
  - Select **ACTIVATE** manually or by pressing "**3**" again
  - Listen for a response from the receiver through the VR100 speaker; "**Sx**", where "**x**" is a number, may also flash on the screen. If the response is successfully received and decoded, you will see the message saying "**Opening**" in the deck box screen and the distance of the hydrophone from the receiver. If you heard a response from the speaker in the form of rhythmic "clicks" but did not see an "Opening" message, the unit has still been released
  - After a few seconds, Select **STATUS** to update the release status and depth. If the release is successful, the screen will show the message "**Open**" and you should notice the depth changed. If the receiver is stuck at the same depth after a few **STATUS** attempts, you can consider the unit "stuck"
